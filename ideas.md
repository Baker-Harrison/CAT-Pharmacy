# 🏥 CAT Pharmacy High-Performance Roadmap (10x Scope)

This document outlines the **10x Vision** for CAT Pharmacy. We are moving beyond "study app" territory into a **Medical Simulation & Clinical Reasoning Platform**.

---

## 🚀 1. From "Static Slides" to "Living Knowledge Graph"
**Current**: Parsing PPTX files into text questions.
**10x Scope**:
*   **The "World Graph" Ingestion**: Automatically ingest and cross-reference **FDA DailyMed**, **PubMed guidelines**, and **ClinicalTrials.gov**.
*   **Real-Time Guideline Sync**: When the American Heart Association updates BP guidelines, the entire graph updates. Deprecated questions are automatically flagged or rewritten by the AI.
*   **Semantic Conflict Detection**: The AI detects if a professor's slide contradicts a new national guideline and flags it for review ("Dr. Smith's slide says X, but 2024 Guidelines say Y").

## 🏥 2. The "Clinical Metaverse" (Simulation Over Multiple Choice)
**Current**: Multiple choice questions (A, B, C, D).
**10x Scope**:
*   **Generative EHR Simulation**: A full-screen UI that mimics Epic/Cerner. The user must "open" a patient chart, order labs, verify prescriptions, and write progress notes.
*   **Multi-Agent Hospital**:
    *   **Nurse Agent**: "Patient in room 302 is hypotensive." (User must prioritize/triage).
    *   **Prescriber Agent**: Writes a dangerous interaction. (User must catch it and professionally intervene via chat).
    *   **Patient Agent**: Simulates non-adherence ("I stopped taking the blue pill because it made me dizzy").
*   **Physical Exam VR/AR**: Use generative imagery/video to show a "rash" or "edema". The user must "inspect" the patient to find the clue.

## 🧠 3. Neural-Symbolic Reasoning Engine
**Current**: IRT (Item Response Theory) + Simple Mastery.
**10x Scope**:
*   **Causal Inference Engine**: The AI doesn't just know "A is correct"; it models the *physiological mechanism*. It can explain *why* a beta-blocker causes bradycardia using a causal chain (Beta-1 blockade -> decreased cAMP -> reduced Ca++ influx).
*   **Counterfactual Coaching**: "What if the patient had renal failure? How would your answer change?" The AI dynamically modifies the question constraints to test deep understanding.
*   **Predictive Ability Modeling**: Predict the user's future NAPLEX score with high precision based on concept topology coverage.

## 🗣️ 4. The "Oral Board" Voice Interface
**Current**: Clicking buttons.
**10x Scope**:
*   **Real-Time Counseling Mode**: The user speaks out loud to the "Patient Agent."
    *   *AI Evaluation*: "You missed the warning about dizziness, and your tone was too jargon-heavy."
*   **Socratic Voice Tutor**: A continuous voice conversation while driving/walking. "Hey, let's review Antiarrhythmics. Why do we avoid Amiodarone in pulmonary fibrosis patients?"

## 💼 5. Career & Hospital Integration
**Current**: Generic pharmacy topics.
**10x Scope**:
*   **Hospital Protocol Ingestion**: Allow teaching hospitals to upload their *specific* residency protocols. The app trains residents on *their* hospital's specific wordings and formularies.
*   **Residency Matchmaker**: Analyze the user's "Clinical Fingerprint" (e.g., strong in Infusion, weak in Ambulatory) and suggest best-fit residency programs.
*   **Continuum of Care**: The app follows the user from P1 student -> Resident -> Attending, adjusting the complexity curve over 10 years.

## 🛡️ 6. Enterprise-Grade Adaptive Infrastructure
**Current**: Local JSON files.
**10x Scope**:
*   **Federated Learning**: Train the global difficulty models on data from 10,000 students across different universities without sharing PII.
*   **Plug-and-Play LLM Switchboard**: Hot-swap between Gemini 2.0 (Reasoning), Med-PaLM (Medical Accuracy), and local LLaMA (Privacy) depending on the task difficulty.
*   **Blockchain Credentialing**: Mint "Micro-Mastery" NFTs for specific clinical skills (e.g., "Certified Anticoagulation Expert") that can be verified by employers.

## ⏱️ 7. The "Alpha Protocol" (Timeback Mastery)
**Current**: Studying 6 hours/day (Lecture -> Note Taking -> Review).
**10x Scope**:
*   **"2-Hour Learning" Engine**: Based on Alpha School's model. The app generates a "Cold Start" quiz. If the user passes the "Hypertension" pre-test with 90%, they *skip* the lecture and get "Timeback."
*   **Ruthless Mastery Gates**: The user *cannot* access the "Cardiology" module until "Renal Physiology" is at 99% mastery. No "C-minus students" allowed to progress. 
*   **The Black Box**: A zero-tolerance error log. You cannot end the daily session until your "Black Box" of missed concepts is empty.
